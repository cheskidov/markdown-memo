# Tables

Tables aren't a Markdown part, but many handlers like Markdown Here and Github support them.

Vertical lines represent columns.
Outside vertical lines (|) are optional and are only needed to make the Markdown code look pretty.


| TABLES        | are                | cool  |
| ------------- |:------------------:| -----:|
| column 3      | right aligned      | $1600 |
| column 2      | centered           |   $12 |
| zebra lines   | are cool           |    $1 |
